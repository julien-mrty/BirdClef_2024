## Introduction

The BirdClef_2024 project aims to develop a neural network capable of identifying bird species from audio recordings. This initiative aligns with the BirdCLEF 2024 challenge, which focuses on the acoustic identification of under-studied bird species in the Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot in India. The challenge encourages the development of computational solutions to process continuous audio data and recognize species by their calls, aiding conservation efforts.
